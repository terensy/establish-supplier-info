There is a cloud agent company that needs to optimize its accounting payment information for AWS services.
The Accounting and SAP teams have requested the billing team to load AWS branch information into accounting reports and APAR data to determine which branches to pay.

The SA document initially introduces the billing system and analyzes the coding of the invoice ID, which can identify the branch that issued the invoice. 
Secondly, it is necessary to check all tables that require a new column to record branch information and create a new column schema.
